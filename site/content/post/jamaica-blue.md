# **JavaScript**

Any dynamic programming during the request/response cycle is handled by JavaScript, running entirely on the client. This could be any frontend framework, library, or even vanilla JavaScript.

## APIs

All server-side processes or database actions are abstracted into reusable APIs, accessed over HTTPS with JavaScript. These can be custom-built or leverage third-party services.

## Markup

Templated markup should be prebuilt at deploy time, usually using a site generator for content sites, or a build tool for web apps.
